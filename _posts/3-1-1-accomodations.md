## Accommodations

For out-of-town visitors, we have blocked a set of rooms at [the Hilton Garden Inn in Palo Alto](http://hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/california/hilton-garden-inn-palo-alto-PAOCRGI/index.html).

Please give the group code to your guests so that they can book their rooms online  at www.paloalto.hgi.com or by calling 877-782-9444.
 
**Online booking instructions:**
- Go to http://paloalto.hgi.com
- Toward the top right, enter the dates.
- Click the link below the red button that says "Add special rate codes."
- In the "group code" box, enter **CMW122**
- Click the red "Check Room and Rates" button.
 
Or call 877-782-9444 to book over the phone.


> Go to [the hotel site](http://paloalto.hgi.com).
Toward the top right enter the dates,  and before you hit the red button “check rooms and rates”, right below hit the more options, then select add special rate codes.  Then enter group code CMW122  and proceed by hitting check room and rates.

We recommend that visitors rent a car, or be prepared for long and unpredictable bus timings. The Bay Area has its strengths, but public transportation is not one of them.
