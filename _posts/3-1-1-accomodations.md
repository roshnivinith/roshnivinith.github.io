## Accommodations

For out-of-town visitors, we have blocked a set of rooms at [the Hilton Garden Inn in Palo Alto](http://hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/california/hilton-garden-inn-palo-alto-PAOCRGI/index.html). The group code is CMW122.

> Go to [the hotel site](http://paloalto.hgi.com).
Toward the top right enter the dates,  and before you hit the red button “check rooms and rates”, right below hit the more options, then select add special rate codes.  Then enter group code CMW122  and proceed by hitting check room and rates.

We recommend that visitors rent a car, or be prepared for long and unpredictable bus timings. The Bay Area has its strengths, but public transportation is not one of them.
