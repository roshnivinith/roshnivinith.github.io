## Accommodations

For out-of-town visitors, we have blocked a set of rooms at [the Hilton Garden Inn in Palo Alto](http://hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/california/hilton-garden-inn-palo-alto-PAOCRGI/index.html).

**Online booking instructions:**   
- Go to http://paloalto.hgi.com   
- Toward the top right, enter the dates (01/22/2016 and/or 01/23/2016)   
- Click the link below the red button that says "Add special rate codes."   
- In the "group code" box, enter **CMW122**   
- Click the red "Check Room and Rates" button.   
 
Or call 877-782-9444 to book over the phone.







We recommend that visitors rent a car, or be prepared for long and unpredictable bus timings. The Bay Area has its strengths, but public transportation is not one of them.
