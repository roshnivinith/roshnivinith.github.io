## Accommodations

For out-of-town visitors, we have blocked a set of rooms at [the Hilton Garden Inn in Palo Alto](http://hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/california/hilton-garden-inn-palo-alto-PAOCRGI/index.html).

We recommend that visitors rent a car, or be prepared for long and unpredictable bus timings. The Bay Area has its strengths, but public transportation is not one of them.
