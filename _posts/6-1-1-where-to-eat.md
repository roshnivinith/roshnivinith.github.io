## Where to Eat

### Some of our regular haunts
- **[Los Pericos](http://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-los-pericos-campbell)** is currently our favorite taqueria.  And given our love of Mexican food, you know we've tried a lot of them!  We recommend the chicken fajitas, the wet burrito, the chimichanga, and the chilaquiles.<br>
- **[Los Charros](http://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-los-charros-mountain-view)** is a close second.  We recommend the burritos (the Charro burrito is a unique one--with cactus!)<br>
- **[Sancho's](http://sanchostaqueria.com/)** has Vinith's two favorite burritos of all time:  the chicken mole burrito and the fried fish burrito. <br>
- **[El Farolito](http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-farolito-san-francisco-2)** is generally accepted to be the best burrito in the world.  It's all the way in San Francisco, but we stop by every time we go to the city.<br><br>

### Our non-Mexican Favorites
- **[Los Gatos Cafe](http://www.losgatoscafe.com/downtown.html)**:  Best Brunch Ever.<br>
- **[Oren's](http://orenshummus.com/)**:  The chicken skewers and the hummus are amazing.  Locations in Palo Alto and Mountain View.<br>
- **[Crepevine](http://www.crepevine.com/)**:  Huge portions.  Locations in Palo Alto and Mountain View.<br>
- **[Rick's Ice Cream](http://www.ricksicecream.com/)**:  Try the industrial chocolate and the lemon chiffon. <br>
- **[Stan's donuts](http://www.yelp.com/biz/stans-donut-shop-santa-clara)**
- **[Dosa SF](http://dosasf.com/)**<br>

### More Bay Area Must-eats
- **[In n Out](http://www.in-n-out.com/)**:  The iconic California burger chain.  The grilled cheese is pretty good, too.<br>
- ****[Philz Coffee](http://www.philzcoffee.com/)**** is all the rage with the entrepreneurial crowd.  Locations scattered around the bay area. <br>
