## Where to Eat

### Some of our regular haunts
- **[Los Pericos](http://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-los-pericos-campbell)** is currently our favorite taqueria.  And given our love of Mexican food, you know we've tried a lot of them!  We recommend the chicken fajitas, the wet burrito, the chimichanga, and the chilaquiles.<br>
- **[Los Charros](http://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-los-charros-mountain-view)** is a close second.  We recommend the burritos (the Charro burrito is a unique one--with cactus!)<br>
- **[Sancho's](http://sanchostaqueria.com/)** has Vinith's two favorite burritos of all time:  the chicken mole burrito and the fried fish burrito. <br>
- El Farolito is generally accepted to be the best burrito in the world.  It's all the way in San Francisco, but we stop by every time we go to the city.<br><br>

### Our non-Mexican Favorites
- Los Gatos Cafe
oren's
crepevine
old siam, thaiphoon, banh thai (in fremont)
really fancy: all spice, plumed horse
dosa sf
rick's ice cream
in n out (and five guys!)
stan's fresh donuts

### More Bay Area Must-eats
- **Philz Coffee** is all the rage with the entrepreneurial crowd.  Locations scattered around the bay area. <br>
