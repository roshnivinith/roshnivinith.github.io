## Where to Eat
<center>For us, this is basically "What to do."</center>

### Absolute Favorites from Around the World!
- **[Los Pericos](http://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-los-pericos-campbell)** is the currently reigning World Champion as far as we're concerned.  We've eaten pretty much everywhere Mexican, and this diamond in the rough takes the cake.  We recommend the chicken fajitas, the wet burrito, the chimichanga, and the chilaquiles (red sauce). Their freshly made chips/salsa are our favorites too.<br>
- **[Los Charros](http://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-los-charros-mountain-view)** is a close second.  We recommend the burritos. Grilled chicken > shredded chicken at this place, and Roshni has recently discovered a soft spot for the Charro burrito, which features cactus! <br>
- **[Sancho's](http://sanchostaqueria.com/)** has Vinith's two favorite burritos of all time:  the chicken mole burrito and the fried fish burrito. Palo Alto denizens worship this place and with good reason. Their ceviche is pretty awesome too.<br>
- **[El Farolito](http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-farolito-san-francisco-2)** is generally accepted to be the best burrito in the world.  It's all the way in San Francisco, and there's always a line, but we stop by every time we pass by.<br><br>

### Absolute Favorites from Around the World! (excluding Mexican)
- **[Los Gatos Cafe](http://www.losgatoscafe.com/downtown.html)**:  Best Brunch Ever. Crabcakes, Copenhagen pancakes, and pretty much anything to be honest. You'd have to try pretty hard to screw this up. Cash only and expect a wait, but it's worth it.<br>
- **[Oren's](http://orenshummus.com/)**:  The chicken skewers are great here, but their vegetarian dishes are amazing as well.  We highly recommend trying a variety of sides in addition to the main courses. Locations in Palo Alto and Mountain View, and you'll probably have to wait a bit. <br>
- **[Crepevine](http://www.crepevine.com/)**:  Huge portions, great variety. If you don't know what to eat, just go here.  Locations in Palo Alto and Mountain View.<br>
- **[Rick's Ice Cream](http://www.ricksicecream.com/)**:  We've tried every ice cream shop around, and nothing comes close. Try the industrial chocolate (Vinith) and the lemon chiffon (Roshni). <br>
- **[Stan's donuts](http://www.yelp.com/biz/stans-donut-shop-santa-clara)** Roshni didn't like donuts till she had FRESH OUT OF THE FRYER donuts from Stan. Seriously, show up at some time before 11am, and ask them for the freshest batch (of any variety). It's even worth waiting for the next batch.
- **[Dosa SF](http://dosasf.com/)**<br> One of the few Indian places we really like, but it's in the city. Kind of upscale and fusion-y, but they know their south indian food.
- If your wallet is feeling too heavy for comfort, try **[All Spice](http://www.allspicerestaurant.com/)**. It's an Indian-and-then-some restaraunt with a Michelin Star, and unlike most starred restaraunts the emphasis here is more on the food than on the decor. Fancy and creative stuff. 
- Another option for burning through some cash is the tasting menu at **[Plumed Horse](http://www.plumedhorse.com/)**.  Amazing dishes and awesome atmosphere.  It's a standard Silicon Valley anniversary dinner spot.<br><br>

### More Bay Area Must-eats
- **[In n Out](http://www.in-n-out.com/)**:  The iconic California burger chain.  The grilled cheese is pretty good, too. Animal Style fries if you're looking to take a few months off your life expectancy. There are plenty of Five Guys in the area too if you're looking to compare (Vinith's opinion: the 5 guys patties win by a landslide, but the Innout burger is overall a better experience)<br>
- **[Philz Coffee](http://www.philzcoffee.com/)** is all the rage with the entrepreneurial crowd and Vinith's relatives in North Carolina.  Locations scattered around the bay area. <br>
