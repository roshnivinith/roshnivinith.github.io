## What To Do

<center>The Bay Area is filled with things to do!  Here are a few of our favorites, sorted roughly geographically<br><br></center>

### Mountain View Area (close to the museum and the hotel) <br>
- **[Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/)**:  Of course this tops the list!  Email us at roshnivinith@gmail.com for free passes! <br>
- **Tech Companies**:  [Google](https://goo.gl/maps/bPbgYhryxiN2), [Facebook](https://goo.gl/maps/KwvFRBggN9w), and [Cisco](https://goo.gl/maps/HTYtAzco5Vp) all have impressive campuses <br>
- **Stanford Campus**:  Obviously we are a little biased, but it's beautiful!  Some must-see spots include [Palm Drive and the Stanford Oval](https://goo.gl/maps/61bb2fPvPKF2), [the engineering quad](https://goo.gl/maps/uwP2sfPy46E2) (our second home for many years), and the [Cantor Art Museum](http://museum.stanford.edu/).  A detailed map with parking is [here](http://maps.stanford.edu/sites/all/lbre-shared/files/maps/files/shared/file/maps_records/Parking_And_Circulation_Map.pdf). <br>
- **[Stanford Theater](http://www.stanfordtheatre.org/)**:  Watch classic movies (on the cheap!) the way they were meant to be seen at this ornate theater in downtown Palo Alto.<br>
- **[Stanford Shopping Center](http://www.simon.com/mall/stanford-shopping-center)**<br>
- **[Fry's](http://www.frys.com/)**:  The world-famous supermarket for tech enthusiasts.  Each location has a different theme! <br>
- **Museums**:  The [Tech Museum](http://www.thetech.org/) and the [Children's Discovery Museum](https://www.cdm.org/) in downtown San Jose were two of our most-frequented spots as kids, so we highly recommend them for our younger guests!<br>
- **Hikes**:  Despite the hustle and bustle of Silicon Valley, the bay area has an almost-unlimited number of gorgeous hikes.  With all the hills surrounding us, you're sure to get some amazing views.  [Bay Area Hiker](http://bahiker.com/) has an extensive list.  Some of our favorites include:  [La Honda Creek](http://www.openspace.org/preserves/la-honda-creek) (where we got engaged!), the [Stanford Dish](https://dish.stanford.edu/), [Fremont Older Preserve](http://www.openspace.org/preserves/fremont-older), and [Mission Peak](http://www.ebparks.org/parks/mission)<br><br>

### San Francisco <br>
Of course if you are all the way here, you have to visit San Francisco!  Locals call t "the city" and it is less than an hour's drive from Mountain View.  The [Caltrain](http://www.caltrain.com/) and [BART](https://www.bart.gov/) can help you get up to the city if you want to avoid the traffic and parking. <br><br>

- **[Golden Gate Bridge](http://www.goldengatebridge.org/)**:  The iconic SF landmark!  Note that it is NOT located in Golden Gate Park! <br>
- **[Lombard Street](https://goo.gl/maps/LZTFgtZYBDP2)**:  Walk down that crooked street you see in all the pictures!  This street really captures the essense of those San Francisco hills.<br>
- **[Ghiradelli Square](http://www.ghirardellisq.com/)**:  The ice cream sundaes are incredible!<br>
- **[Pier 39](http://www.pier39.com/) and [Fisherman's Wharf](http://www.fishermanswharf.org/)**:  More iconic SF.<br>
- **[Alcatraz](http://www.nps.gov/alca/index.htm)**:  Does this need any explanation??<br>
- **[Twin Peaks](http://sfrecpark.org/destination/twin-peaks/)**:  Drive to the top of Twin Peaks on a clear day for gorgeous views of the city and the bay.<br>
- **Museums**:  For the scientists, the [Exploratorium](http://www.exploratorium.edu/) is amazing and the [Legion of Honor](http://legionofhonor.famsf.org/) is an art museum with amazing architecture and views of the water.<br><br>

### For the more adventurous <br>
- **[Half Moon Bay](http://www.visithalfmoonbay.org/)**:  The closest beach.  But be warned:  the Pacific Ocean is always, always freezing!<br>
- **More Hikes Further North**:  [Point Reyes](http://www.nps.gov/pore/index.htm) and [Muir Woods](http://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm).<br>
- **[Napa](http://www.visitnapavalley.com/)/[Sonoma](http://www.sonomacounty.com/)**:  Beautiful views, amazing wine, and Michelin-starred meals.  (Also further north)<br>
- **Beaches and Hikes to the South**:  [Santa Cruz](http://beachboardwalk.com/), [Monterey](http://www.monterey.com/), [Big Sur](http://www.bigsurcalifornia.org/).<br>
