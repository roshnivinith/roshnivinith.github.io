## Things To Do

The Bay Area is filled with things to do!  Here are a few of our favorites, sorted roughly geographically<br>

### Mountain View Area (close to the museum and the hotel): <br>
- **[Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/)**:  Of course this tops the list!  Email us at roshnivinith@gmail.com for free passes! <br>
- **Tech Companies**:  [Google](https://goo.gl/maps/bPbgYhryxiN2), [Facebook](https://goo.gl/maps/KwvFRBggN9w), and [Cisco](https://goo.gl/maps/HTYtAzco5Vp) all have impressive campuses <br>
- **Stanford Campus**:  Obviously we are a little biased, but it's beautiful!  Some must-see spots include [Palm Drive and the Stanford Oval](https://goo.gl/maps/61bb2fPvPKF2), [the engineering quad](https://goo.gl/maps/uwP2sfPy46E2) (our second home for many years), and the [Cantor Art Museum](http://museum.stanford.edu/).  A detailed map with parking is [here](http://maps.stanford.edu/sites/all/lbre-shared/files/maps/files/shared/file/maps_records/Parking_And_Circulation_Map.pdf). <br>
- **[Stanford Theater](http://www.stanfordtheatre.org/)**:  Watch classic movies (on the cheap!) the way they were meant to be seen at this ornate theater in downtown Palo Alto.<br>
- **[Stanford Shopping Center](http://www.simon.com/mall/stanford-shopping-center)**<br>
- **[Fry's](http://www.frys.com/)**:  The world-famous supermarket for tech enthusiasts.  Each location has a different theme! <br>
- **Half Moon Bay**:  The closest beach.  But be warned:  the Pacific Ocean is always, always freezing!<br>
- **Hikes**:  la honda preserve, the dish, fremont old preserve, sanborn park, castle rock, mission peak, bahiker <br>
