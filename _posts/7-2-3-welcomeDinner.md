## Welcome Dinner

_Friday, January 22, 2016, 6PM_
Mitchell Park Community Center
3700 Middlefield Road
Palo Alto, CA 94303

Join us for a casual evening of food and music.  There will be dinner and a couple of musical performances, followed by traditional Indian folk dancing ([dandiya raas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandiya_Raas)).  The steps are simple and fun; come dressed in festive clothes, ready to dance!
